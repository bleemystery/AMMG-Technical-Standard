# AMMG Technical Standard & BID Architecture
**Official Specification | v1.0.4 (January 2026)**

## 1. Abstract
This specification defines the **AMMG** (Automated Murder Mystery Game) standard. AMMG systems utilize a **Bimodal Information Distribution (BID)** model to eliminate "Host Burden," allowing for 100% peer-level participation in immersive narratives. By separating shared narrative logic from private data, the system achieves host-free automation.

## 2. Core Technical Definitions
- **AMMG (Automated Murder Mystery Game):** A narrative framework where game logic, pacing, and data distribution are handled by algorithmic facilitators rather than human hosts.
- **CNN (Central Narrative Node):** A shared visual interface (e.g., Smart TV) used for universal story progression and act transitions.
- **PPN (Peripheral Participant Node):** Individual private interfaces (e.g., Smartphones) used for confidential character motives and cryptographic clue delivery.

## 3. Performance Metrics
Systems compliant with the AMMG standard must demonstrate a **Facilitation Latency ($L_f$)** of less than 30 seconds per game-state transition, ensuring cinematic pacing that exceeds manual capabilities.

## 4. Official Research Record
